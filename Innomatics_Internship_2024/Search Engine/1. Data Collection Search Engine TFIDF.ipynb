As soon as we entered the room   he covered my mouth                                       and put a syringe on my neck.                                       I heard it clearly.

If we let this go on   Cho Junghyun will also                                          Do you want Gu Jingi  to kill Cho Junghyun too                                        If you re his family                                        stop him before this becomes more serious.                                       But how                                        Let s call the secretaries                                       and the Security Team.                                       They both report to Mr. Cheon                                        so they might know something.                                       We can use                                       even the smallest lead right now.                                       Keep a close eye on Pyo Eunsil  from now on.                                       If Mr. Cheon wants  to reach out to Gu Jingi                                        he must get through Pyo Eunsil.                                        Did you have to do it like this                                         You could ve told me.                                         You knew my mother would be shocked.   You already knew too.                                        You were at the penthouse too.                                        Back then                                           Back then  I was out of it.                                        Sure.                                        It must ve come as a big shock.                                        You probably never imagined  your father illegally transplanted                                        somebody else s organ.                                        If you wish to do him good   then find where Mr. Cheon is                                        before Cho Junghyun dies.                                        No one is truly trustworthy.

Your Honor   I am sorry to interrupt the trial.                                        I am Attorney Han Yihan   representing Cheon Hyungu  the accomplice                                        and the witness  Cho Junghyun.                                        My client wanted  to turn himself in to the police today                                         but the Security Team  of Banseok attacked him                                        and made an attempt  to destroy the evidence.                                        Evidence  What evidence                                         This phone has the record  of every single crime                                        which the defendant has ordered  my client for years.                                        Your Honor  I would like to call  Cheon Hyungu to the stand.                                        Impossible. We did not agree  on having Mr. Cheon Hyungu.                                        He s a wanted criminal at the moment.                                        We must send him to the police  and have him questioned.                                        I couldn t make a request beforehand  because he was wanted by the police.                                        The attorney has previously stated that                                        Cheon Hyungu is the real culprit  who killed Lee Dohyung                                         so we must confirm the truth  with Cheon Hyungu himself.                                        We must reach an agreement.                                        We ll adjourn for    minutes                                         then decide if Mr. Cheon will be  allowed to witness without summons.                                        All rise.                                         Attorney Han appeared in court  during the trial                                        and stated there s evidence that supports                                        Gu Jingi s charges                                        in the phone used by Mr. Cheon                                         Gu Jingi s accomplice.

Five years ago  I got into an accident                                        because Gu Jingi deceived me.                                        What are you doing  That was dangerous.                                        It has been a while  Boss.                                        No  you aren t my boss any more.

So should we meet right now                                         My new boss wants to talk to you.                                        Fine. Come to my penthouse right now.                                        Witness.  Around    a.m. on March   rd                                               you met Assistant Director Lee Dohyung  with Gu Jingi  the defendant.                                         Yes.   In the video of the said day                                         the defendant gave you an order                                        to take care of the victim  Lee Dohyung   within Banseokwon.                                        Let me ask.                                        Witness  did you kill the victim                                         I said                                           we should let him live.                                        It was a hospital  so he could have lived  if we moved him and treated him.                                        However                                         Chairman Gu stopped me.                                        Do you know what I regret the most                                         Five years ago in the detention center   letting Han Yihan go alive.                                         What s he saying    Han Yihan  That lawyer                                          Letting him live    What did he do                                          Five years ago in the detention center   letting Han Yihan go alive.                                         What does this mean                                         Your Honor  what happened  five years ago is unrelated to this                                          No  it s a part of the evidence   so we ll hear from him.                                        Five years ago   Chairman Gu gave me an order                                        to instigate Gong Gukkwang and assault  Lawyer Han Yihan in the detention center.                                        And on the night of the assault   he visited Mr. Han Yihan                                        and told him that he d die there                                        unless he admitted to the malpractice  he had committed against Geum Seokju.                                        Did he make you abduct Cho Junghyun too                                         Yes  he told me to abduct her  kill her                                         then hide her body.                                        Why didn t you do as he said                                         Because I knew I ve been betrayed                                        thanks to Mr. Han Yihan.                                        Do you have evidence  to back up your statements                                         On the phone we just spoke                                         you ll find every single order  I got from him for the last five years.                                        I ll confirm the contents of his phone                                        and turn it in as evidence for this trial.                                        That s all.                                        Counsel  would you like to question him                                         No  I will not.                                        Your Honor  I d like to call  Cho Junghyun to the stand.                                        Ms. Cho.                                         Yes.   Can you bear witness                                         I can.                                        I understand. Please get ready.                                        Not bad.                                        I guess Banseok adored you                                        without knowing you ll betray them.                                        Are you complaining about bringing  the biggest benefit to Honours Hand                                         Also                                         I think you re the one  who came to stab me in the back.                                        Stab you in the back                                         As the Chief Director of the headquarters                                         I came to inspect you   the head of the Asian branch.                                        I came to verify the report  that you received                                        illegal heart transplant surgery  in return for our investment.                                        You heard such nonsense and came this far                                         I guess the chief director                                        doesn t have much to do.                                        We ll find out soon  if this was nonsense or not.                                        Han Yihan said                                        he ll reveal everything  between you and Gu Jingi on trial today.                                        If it is true  I can just go back                                         but what about you   That ll be the end of you.                                        Witness  in the morning  of November   st                                               did you take part  in the heart transplant surgery                                        along with the defendant   Gu Jingi  at Banseokwon                                         Yes  I did.                                        The heart he used  during the transplant surgery.                                        Who did it belong to                                         It was the heart of Geum Seokju.                                        Who                                           Who took out                                           the heart                                         Chairman Gu Jingi did.                                        And I helped him.                                        You re going to put him on ECMO                                         He s recovering well. Why                                         Just do as I say.                                        Don t ask questions.                                        But this is just                                           Don t you want                                        Junhwan to live                                          Sorry    There s this new drug.                                        It treats hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  by internal treatment.                                        Of course  it s approved by the FDA.                                        It s rarely used locally.                                        It costs millions of won per injection.                                        And it s not covered by insurance.                                        I ll give it to Junhwan.                                        And I ll pay for everything.                                        Although it s on the premise                                        that you ll help me.                                        I knew his order wasn t normal                                         but I couldn t turn it down.                                        Back then  I thought                                        the new drug was going to save my son.                                        Did Gu Jingi                                        take out the heart                                        from the patient himself                                         Yes.                                        Yes  he took the heart out  from Geum Seokju                                         put it into the VIP patient s chest   then sutured him.                                        After that  Chairman Gu  called Dr. Han Yihan                                        and had him transplant                                        Geum Seokju s heart  into the VIP patient s chest.                                        And the next morning                                         the chairman destroyed  the ECMO Geum Seokju was on                                        and finished his life.                                        Witness.                                        You just confessed to your criminal case.                                        Are you aware of this                                         Yes.                                        I m going to confess  to all the crimes I committed                                        and face the punishment.                                        I see.                                        Prosecution.  Do you have anything more to add                                         Prosecution. Are you okay                                         I m all right.                                        I m okay.                                        Prosecutor Geum.                                        Seokyeong.                                        Call an ambulance. Hurry                                         Can you hear me                                         Seokyeong.                                        Yes. It just ended.                                        Gosh. Things got a bit complicated.                                        Cheon Hyungu and Cho Junghyun testified   so we were close.                                        But Prosecutor Geum collapsed   so the trial was halted.                                        She collapsed                                         I guess things didn t go well                                         Okay.                                        The prosecutor collapsed   so the trial was halted.                                        You re lucky.                                        But it won t change anything.  Things just got delayed. That s all.                                        We will stop questioning  the witnesses here.                                        And we will set a date  for the next hearing.                                        As soon as I hear from the prosecutor   we ll set a date to continue.                                        Yes  Your Honor.                                        All rise.                                        Chairman Gu.                                        Good work.                                        Father.                                         Hyunseong.   Why                                           Why did you do it                                         I m sorry.                                        All I can say to you is                                           I m sorry.                                        My son.                                        All right. Let s go.                                        Dilated cardiomyopathy.                                        I understand that  it s a hereditary disease.                                        How could she have  the same condition as Seokju                                         This is awful.                                        If something bad were to happen to her                                         Yihan would                                           The price went down  as soon as the market opened.                                        Gu Jingi s trial yesterday  must have shocked a lot of people.                                        There were a lot of articles  about you and Honours Hand.                                        It says how a foreign company was about  to take over Korea s leading bio company                                        and how there was a suspicion                                        of illegal organ harvesting  during the process.                                        I don t care.                                        A suspicion is just a suspicion.                                        I m going to leave the country as soon  as I redeem my investment in stocks.                                        You ll come with me  right                                         Of course  I m coming with you.                                        I need to get a medical checkup  as an outpatient at Banseokwon.                                         A medical checkup    There s something I must find.                                        Tell the medical director  that I want to see him tonight.                                        What is it                                         Han Yihan reported me  to the bar association                                        for threatening  Park Kitae and Nam Hyukchul                                        and for conspiring  to change the surgeon without consent                                        and to fabricate medical records.                                        I will soon be disbarred.                                        I don t think I can defend you anymore.                                        I m sorry.                                        No  I should apologize.                                        I gave you too big of a burden.                                        Okay. Just relay my message  to the medical director.                                        I ll take care of the rest myself.                                        I m truly sorry that  I can t represent you to the end.                                        Ms. Pyo.                                        Mr. Gu.                                        You have a visit from a lawyer.                                        His name is Han Yihan.                                        Will you turn him away                                          Mr. Han.   Yes.                                        Mr. Gu has agreed to your request.                                        Come with me.                                        Has it been five years since it had been                                           just the two of us like this                                         Why was it Seokju                                         If you needed a heart for your investment                                         you could have figured out another way.                                        Why was it me                                         I didn t know                                        when the hospital would get another heart                                        if not his.                                        And you  Han Yihan                                         were standing my son s way.                                        I thought  I had to get rid of you for good                                         so my son could  no longer be in your shadow.                                        I believed that I had to remove you                                        because he was never going to surpass you.                                        Because of your selfishness                                         I lost everything that mattered to me.                                        My greed                                        caused everything.                                        I m sorry.                                        I m asking you for your forgiveness   but I know it won t be enough.                                        Despite that   I want to protect Banseok no matter what.                                        To stop Jayden from taking over.                                        I hid a video that proves  that Jayden was the recipient                                        of Seokju s heart.                                        Find that video   stop Jayden from taking over                                         and protect Banseok  please.                                        I m begging you.                                        Why are you asking me                                         Han Yihan.                                        You were the only one  who didn t get swallowed in greed.                                        I m ashamed to ask you this.                                        The only person I can trust  is the person I tortured the most.                                        It s you                                         Han Yihan.                                        Han Yihan came to Banseokwon                                         Yes. He went to the VIP floor  with the head of the Security Team.                                        You ll feel dizzy and enervated.                                        After I inject the shot  I ll request  to transfer you to Banseokwon.                                        Okay.                                        Nights here                                           are quite long.                                        Nights                                           This contains evidence  that Jayden took the heart                                         Yes.                                        LAWYER HAN YIHAN                                        I need to check.                                        Director Jung.                                        Why are you here                                         Did you buy off the medical director too                                         It wasn t hard.                                        Those who once caved into money                                        will cave into a bigger sum of money  next time.                                        This is what you used                                        to drug me five years ago.                                        But the dosage is several times higher.                                        So this is the end                                        you wanted all along.                                        Even if you kill me   the truth will come out                                        because I gave Han Yihan the video                                        that proves you got                                        Geum Seokju s heart.                                        Does it look like  I m doing this to silence you                                         No. I m getting revenge.                                        Revenge for taking  the most precious thing in my life.                                        I ll tell you my story now.                                        Once you hear everything  you will                                        understand me too.                                        Why do you suddenly want  to postpone the surgery to tomorrow                                         I apologize.  There is someone I need to meet.                                        Once I get a transplant   I will need to stay here for a month.                                        I must meet this person now.                                        Someone he had to meet                                         Was it                                           What is it                                         I checked Jayden s car accident report  this afternoon.                                        There was a passenger.                                        A passenger                                         That night                                         I left Banseokwon  after taking the drug you gave me                                        because I got a call  that they had found the person                                        I wanted to meet in Korea.                                        You have arrived at your destination.  This is the end of the route guidance.                                        The passenger was Kim Junghye.                                        KIM JUNGHYE  FEMALE                                            She was a    year old woman.                                        She died.                                        The fellow passenger in the car died.                                        I took the heart out myself.                                        I asked him  how he got the heart that night.                                        This is what Gu Jingi said.                                         The fellow passenger in the car died.                                         That s how he took out the heart.                                        Then the heart Jayden received                                        belonged to this woman  not Geum Seokju                                         No. I doubt that.                                        Given the size and condition of the heart                                         it couldn t have belonged  to a woman in her   s.                                        Then who is this woman                                         KIM JUNGHYE  FEMALE      DEAD                                        I heard that you were my son s friend.                                        You re quite handsome.                                        I wonder  if Jaehyuk would ve been handsome too.                                        Your son                                           Do you want                                        to meet Jaehyuk                                         Of course.                                        I even missed him in my dreams.                                        Then why didn t you look for him                                         Jaehyuk                                           really missed you.                                        I was scared.                                        I sent him away to such a faraway country                                        because things got tough for me.                                        Looking for him after all these years  scared me.                                        I didn t want him to see me like this.  I m not exactly well off.                                        So the possibility of becoming  a burden on him also scared me.                                        And when I heard                                        Jaehyuk was looking for me  I was afraid                                         but I still thought I had to see him.                                        I know I can t be forgiven for what I did                                         but I wanted to say this to him at least.                                        That                                           I wanted to see him                                           and missed him too.                                        I resented you a lot                                           because you abandoned me.                                        But                                           I still missed you.                                        Mom.                                        No way. Are you                                           Jaehyuk                                         What is it                                         What s wrong                                         What is it  What s wrong  Jaehyuk                                         Jaehyuk. Oh  no.                                        Jaehyuk. Are you all right                                         Jaehyuk                                         Don t exert yourself.  You still need to rest.                                        Where am I                                         You re in a VIP room at Banseokwon.                                        You were in an accident.                                        An accident                                         But you were very lucky.                                        You were transported to my hospital  right away and were treated accordingly.                                        And your heart transplant  was successful too.                                        I had surgery                                         What about the woman in the car                                         The one in the passenger seat.                                        Unfortunately  she met her end.                                        Ten days have passed since the accident.                                        Our hospital held a funeral for her.                                        The passenger didn t have any family.                                        Did you know the deceased well                                         You took away  the most important thing from me                                        at the moment I had been waiting for.                                        She was the only family I had left.                                        You took my mother from me.                                        Back then                                           Back then                                            I      I want you to regret and be reminded                                        of what you did                                        and die slowly                                        and painfully.                                        And that is the end  I had been planning for you                                           in the past five years.                                        I                                           Jayden didn t want                                        to get the heart transplant that night.                                        That s why                                        Gu Jingi caused the accident.                                        Jayden had to get the heart                                         so Honours Hand would invest in Banseok.                                        It means  Jayden was deceived by Gu Jingi too.                                        Now  I get why                                        Jayden was so determined                                        to get revenge on Gu Jingi.                                         That way.

       "'THE NAMES OF PEOPLE INCIDENTS AND BACKGROUNDS OF THIS DRAMA ARE FICTIONAL How much do you know about your husband Gu Jingi What do you mean What will you do if your husband Gu Jingi killed Prosecutor Geum Seokyeong s brother took out his heart and used it to do an illegal heart transplant What I told you to stay away from nonsense. My father wouldn t do that. He s right. That s impossible. It s true. Chief Cho Junghyun told us everything. She said the chairman took out the heart from Geum Seokju. And he also gave me an order to fabricate the autopsy report. Yoonjung. I m sorry. I should have told you sooner. Are you saying he really killed a patient Mother are you all right I m fine. I m fine so tell me. Why are you suddenly here telling me all this Help us find Mr. Cheon. Then we ll keep Banseok University Medical Center safe from Jayden. How can you Before I tell you how please let those two leave the room. Make Ms. Pyo leave Why She blackmailed Park Kitae fabricated Gil Soyeon s medical record and instigated Nam Hyukchul s false witness. It was all done by her under Gu Jingi s order. Do you have evidence Ma am it s not true. I just did my best for the hospital Leave the room. Ma am. I told you to leave. I understand. ENJOY ALL VOD IN HIGH QUALITY KVOD.TV GET LIVE TV MOVIES SHOWS IN ONE PACKAGE EPISODE What are they going to say I m going to take Honours Hand from Jayden. Every piece of power he has comes from Honours Hand. Take it away How I ll expose that Jayden received an illegal organ transplant. Illegal organ harvesting is a serious crime that can result in capital punishment. If Jayden conspired with Gu Jingi and killed a patient to take out his heart Honours Hand won t condone it. If that s exposed my father Make your choice. Will you protect your husband or save Banseok University Medical Center If you pursue both you ll lose both. It s me Pyo Eunsil. Han Yihan and Geum Seokyeong are at Chairman Gu Jingi s home. They said they came to tell his wife that thing from five years ago. Did you take care of Cho Junghyun Don t let the police find even a piece of her hair. We have no time to lose. It ll be too late if Mr. Cheon runs off after killing Cho Junghyun. What do you mean Why would he kill Cho Junghyun Cho Junghyun went missing at her place yesterday. Her son Nam Junhwan was left behind unconscious. Mr. Cheon abducted her. You already knew that he had been carrying out all kinds of dirty deeds your father asked him to. If you don t trust us you can hear it yourself. Hear it myself From whom Come on in. I got home with my mom. As soon as we entered the room he covered my mouth and put a syringe on my neck. I heard it clearly. My mom begged him to let me go but the guy who had me said The chairman doesn t want any loose ends. Please make sure you keep him safe. We never know. Yes he ll be safe with me. Let s go. We must locate Mr. Cheon as soon as possible. If we let this go on Cho Junghyun will also Do you want Gu Jingi to kill Cho Junghyun too If you re his family stop him before this becomes more serious. But how Let s call the secretaries and the Security Team. They both report to Mr. Cheon so they might know something. We can use even the smallest lead right now. Keep a close eye on Pyo Eunsil from now on. If Mr. Cheon wants to reach out to Gu Jingi he must get through Pyo Eunsil. Did you have to do it like this You could ve told me. You knew my mother would be shocked. You already knew too. You were at the penthouse too. Back then Back then I was out of it. Sure. It must ve come as a big shock. You probably never imagined your father illegally transplanted somebody else s organ. If you wish to do him good then find where Mr. Cheon is before Cho Junghyun dies. No one is truly trustworthy. Did you betray us too Why Since she betrayed you will you kill her too Never mind. You ll abduct her confine her assault her then blackmail her. You ve committed all kinds of crimes so you can t back out. But if you won t back out you ll go down with Gu Jingi. You must be anxious. I just did my job as an attorney. Sure. I hope you do your job during the trial tomorrow. It wasn t too fun when you admitted too quickly. I want to put an end to Gu Jingi in court. NEW HOPE LAW OFFICE THE DAY OF GU JINGI S TRIAL CLOSED TEMPORARILY DUE TO A PERSONAL MATTER You re Han Yihan I heard about you. You played a decisive role in bringing down Banseok with Jayden. Let me introduce myself. I m the Chief Director of Honours Hand headquarters Susie Yoon. Nice to meet you. I m Lawyer Han Yihan. Please excuse me. This is important. Please have a seat. Speak. I found Mr. Cheon. He ll turn in the burner phone to the Security Team at p.m. and turn himself in to the police. At p.m. That s half an hour from now. What should I do Let me know where they re meeting. If he runs away keep a moderate distance and tail him. Don t catch him. Don t catch him Why not We should make him talk. Even if he gets caught will he spill everything that easily We must save him instead of catching him. That way he ll trust us. Okay. I m sorry. It seems urgent. You should go. I ll hear the rest from them. Thank you. Over there Get in. I don t think you have any time to think. Don t look at me like that. I m here to save you. You Save me Why I want to quit seeing these people. People who get blamed for other people s crimes when they have enough on their hands. What Gu Jingi put every charge on you. Do you get it now If you gave them the phone and turned yourself in you would ve become a murderer. Cho Junghyun better be alive. That s how you ll save yourself. Where is Cho Junghyun COUNSEL DEFENDANT Counsel. What is this What is this noise Suddenly Counsel. Is this phone you have in your hand yours Your Honor. Prosecution has confirmed circumstances that suggest this cellphone possessed by the defendant s counsel is important evidence in this case. Please consent to check it. What are you doing Let go. Prosecution. What do you mean How is it evidence DEFENDANT Who is it It s Cheon Hyungu. Where are you I m at the courthouse. Mr. Cheon Hyungu Yes that s right. Prosecution what is going on Cho Junghyun Cheon Hyungu. Were you planning on killing them both Did you say you were sick of this I m sick of it too so I ll reveal everything right here right now. Your Honor I am sorry to interrupt the trial. I am Attorney Han Yihan representing Cheon Hyungu the accomplice and the witness Cho Junghyun. My client wanted to turn himself in to the police today but the Security Team of Banseok attacked him and made an attempt to destroy the evidence. Evidence What evidence This phone has the record of every single crime which the defendant has ordered my client for years. Your Honor I would like to call Cheon Hyungu to the stand. Impossible. We did not agree on having Mr. Cheon Hyungu. He s a wanted criminal at the moment. We must send him to the police and have him questioned. I couldn t make a request beforehand because he was wanted by the police. The attorney has previously stated that Cheon Hyungu is the real culprit who killed Lee Dohyung so we must confirm the truth with Cheon Hyungu himself. We must reach an agreement. We ll adjourn for minutes then decide if Mr. Cheon will be allowed to witness without summons. All rise. Attorney Han appeared in court during the trial and stated there s evidence that supports Gu Jingi s charges in the phone used by Mr. Cheon Gu Jingi s accomplice. Isn t this dangerous You said we had to go somewhere together. Is this it Yes. Five years ago I got into an accident because Gu Jingi deceived me. What are you doing That was dangerous. It has been a while Boss. No you aren t my boss any more. Jayden. You told Han Yihan about me. What can I do I needed to save myself. So should we meet right now My new boss wants to talk to you. Fine. Come to my penthouse right now. Witness. Around a.m. on March rd you met Assistant Director Lee Dohyung with Gu Jingi the defendant. Yes. In the video of the said day the defendant gave you an order to take care of the victim Lee Dohyung within Banseokwon. Let me ask. Witness did you kill the victim I said we should let him live. It was a hospital so he could have lived if we moved him and treated him. However Chairman Gu stopped me. Do you know what I regret the most Five years ago in the detention center letting Han Yihan go alive. What s he saying Han Yihan That lawyer Letting him live What did he do Five years ago in the detention center letting Han Yihan go alive. What does this mean Your Honor what happened five years ago is unrelated to this No it s a part of the evidence so we ll hear from him. Five years ago Chairman Gu gave me an order to instigate Gong Gukkwang and assault Lawyer Han Yihan in the detention center. And on the night of the assault he visited Mr. Han Yihan and told him that he d die there unless he admitted to the malpractice he had committed against Geum Seokju. Did he make you abduct Cho Junghyun too Yes he told me to abduct her kill her then hide her body. Why didn t you do as he said Because I knew I ve been betrayed thanks to Mr. Han Yihan. Do you have evidence to back up your statements On the phone we just spoke you ll find every single order I got from him for the last five years. I ll confirm the contents of his phone and turn it in as evidence for this trial. That s all. Counsel would you like to question him No I will not. Your Honor I d like to call Cho Junghyun to the stand. Ms. Cho. Yes. Can you bear witness I can. I understand. Please get ready. Not bad. I guess Banseok adored you without knowing you ll betray them. Are you complaining about bringing the biggest benefit to Honours Hand Also I think you re the one who came to stab me in the back. Stab you in the back As the Chief Director of the headquarters I came to inspect you the head of the Asian branch. I came to verify the report that you received illegal heart transplant surgery in return for our investment. You heard such nonsense and came this far I guess the chief director doesn t have much to do. We ll find out soon if this was nonsense or not. Han Yihan said he ll reveal everything between you and Gu Jingi on trial today. If it is true I can just go back but what about you That ll be the end of you. Witness in the morning of November st did you take part in the heart transplant surgery along with the defendant Gu Jingi at Banseokwon Yes I did. The heart he used during the transplant surgery. Who did it belong to It was the heart of Geum Seokju. Who Who took out the heart Chairman Gu Jingi did. And I helped him. You re going to put him on ECMO He s recovering well. Why Just do as I say. Don t ask questions. But this is just Don t you want Junhwan to live Sorry There s this new drug. It treats hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by internal treatment. Of course it s approved by the FDA. It s rarely used locally. It costs millions of won per injection. And it s not covered by insurance. I ll give it to Junhwan. And I ll pay for everything. Although it s on the premise that you ll help me. I knew his order wasn t normal but I couldn t turn it down. Back then I thought the new drug was going to save my son. Did Gu Jingi take out the heart from the patient himself Yes. Yes he took the heart out from Geum Seokju put it into the VIP patient s chest then sutured him. After that Chairman Gu called Dr. Han Yihan and had him transplant Geum Seokju s heart into the VIP patient s chest. And the next morning the chairman destroyed the ECMO Geum Seokju was on and finished his life. Witness. You just confessed to your criminal case. Are you aware of this Yes. I m going to confess to all the crimes I committed and face the punishment. I see. Prosecution. Do you have anything more to add Prosecution. Are you okay I m all right. I m okay. Prosecutor Geum. Seokyeong. Call an ambulance. Hurry Can you hear me Seokyeong. Yes. It just ended. Gosh. Things got a bit complicated. Cheon Hyungu and Cho Junghyun testified so we were close. But Prosecutor Geum collapsed so the trial was halted. She collapsed I guess things didn t go well Okay. The prosecutor collapsed so the trial was halted. You re lucky. But it won t change anything. Things just got delayed. That s all. We will stop questioning the witnesses here. And we will set a date for the next hearing. As soon as I hear from the prosecutor we ll set a date to continue. Yes Your Honor. All rise. Chairman Gu. Good work. Father. Hyunseong. Why Why did you do it I m sorry. All I can say to you is I m sorry. My son. All right. Let s go. Dilated cardiomyopathy. I understand that it s a hereditary disease. How could she have the same condition as Seokju This is awful. If something bad were to happen to her Yihan would The price went down as soon as the market opened. Gu Jingi s trial yesterday must have shocked a lot of people. There were a lot of articles about you and Honours Hand. It says how a foreign company was about to take over Korea s leading bio company and how there was a suspicion of illegal organ harvesting during the process. I don t care. A suspicion is just a suspicion. I m going to leave the country as soon as I redeem my investment in stocks. You ll come with me right Of course I m coming with you. I need to get a medical checkup as an outpatient at Banseokwon. A medical checkup There s something I must find. Tell the medical director that I want to see him tonight. What is it Han Yihan reported me to the bar association for threatening Park Kitae and Nam Hyukchul and for conspiring to change the surgeon without consent and to fabricate medical records. I will soon be disbarred. I don t think I can defend you anymore. I m sorry. No I should apologize. I gave you too big of a burden. Okay. Just relay my message to the medical director. I ll take care of the rest myself. I m truly sorry that I can t represent you to the end. Ms. Pyo. Mr. Gu. You have a visit from a lawyer. His name is Han Yihan. Will you turn him away Mr. Han. Yes. Mr. Gu has agreed to your request. Come with me. Has it been five years since it had been just the two of us like this Why was it Seokju If you needed a heart for your investment you could have figured out another way. Why was it me I didn t know when the hospital would get another heart if not his. And you Han Yihan were standing my son s way. I thought I had to get rid of you for good so my son could no longer be in your shadow. I believed that I had to remove you because he was never going to surpass you. Because of your selfishness I lost everything that mattered to me. My greed caused everything. I m sorry. I m asking you for your forgiveness but I know it won t be enough. Despite that I want to protect Banseok no matter what. To stop Jayden from taking over. I hid a video that proves that Jayden was the recipient of Seokju s heart. Find that video stop Jayden from taking over and protect Banseok please. I m begging you. Why are you asking me Han Yihan. You were the only one who didn t get swallowed in greed. I m ashamed to ask you this. The only person I can trust is the person I tortured the most. It s you Han Yihan. Han Yihan came to Banseokwon Yes. He went to the VIP floor with the head of the Security Team. You ll feel dizzy and enervated. After I inject the shot I ll request to transfer you to Banseokwon. Okay. Nights here are quite long. Nights This contains evidence that Jayden took the heart Yes. LAWYER HAN YIHAN I need to check. Director Jung. Why are you here Did you buy off the medical director too It wasn t hard. Those who once caved into money will cave into a bigger sum of money next time. This is what you used to drug me five years ago. But the dosage is several times higher. So this is the end you wanted all along. Even if you kill me the truth will come out because I gave Han Yihan the video that proves you got Geum Seokju s heart. Does it look like I m doing this to silence you No. I m getting revenge. Revenge for taking the most precious thing in my life. I ll tell you my story now. Once you hear everything you will understand me too. Why do you suddenly want to postpone the surgery to tomorrow I apologize. There is someone I need to meet. Once I get a transplant I will need to stay here for a month. I must meet this person now. Someone he had to meet Was it What is it I checked Jayden s car accident report this afternoon. There was a passenger. A passenger That night I left Banseokwon after taking the drug you gave me because I got a call that they had found the person I wanted to meet in Korea. You have arrived at your destination. This is the end of the route guidance. The passenger was Kim Junghye. KIM JUNGHYE FEMALE She was a year old woman. She died. The fellow passenger in the car died. I took the heart out myself. I asked him how he got the heart that night. This is what Gu Jingi said. The fellow passenger in the car died. That s how he took out the heart. Then the heart Jayden received belonged to this woman not Geum Seokju No. I doubt that. Given the size and condition of the heart it couldn t have belonged to a woman in her s. Then who is this woman KIM JUNGHYE FEMALE DEAD I heard that you were my son s friend. You re quite handsome. I wonder if Jaehyuk would ve been handsome too. Your son Do you want to meet Jaehyuk Of course. I even missed him in my dreams. Then why didn t you look for him Jaehyuk really missed you. I was scared. I sent him away to such a faraway country because things got tough for me. Looking for him after all these years scared me. I didn t want him to see me like this. I m not exactly well off. So the possibility of becoming a burden on him also scared me. And when I heard Jaehyuk was looking for me I was afraid but I still thought I had to see him. I know I can t be forgiven for what I did but I wanted to say this to him at least. That I wanted to see him and missed him too. I resented you a lot because you abandoned me. But I still missed you. Mom. No way. Are you Jaehyuk What is it What s wrong What is it What s wrong Jaehyuk Jaehyuk. Oh no. Jaehyuk. Are you all right Jaehyuk Don t exert yourself. You still need to rest. Where am I You re in a VIP room at Banseokwon. You were in an accident. An accident But you were very lucky. You were transported to my hospital right away and were treated accordingly. And your heart transplant was successful too. I had surgery What about the woman in the car The one in the passenger seat. Unfortunately she met her end. Ten days have passed since the accident. Our hospital held a funeral for her. The passenger didn t have any family. Did you know the deceased well You took away the most important thing from me at the moment I had been waiting for. She was the only family I had left. You took my mother from me. Back then Back then I I want you to regret and be reminded of what you did and die slowly and painfully. And that is the end I had been planning for you in the past five years. I Jayden didn t want to get the heart transplant that night. That s why Gu Jingi caused the accident. Jayden had to get the heart so Honours Hand would invest in Banseok. It means Jayden was deceived by Gu Jingi too. Now I get why Jayden was so determined to get revenge on Gu Jingi. That way. Be careful. Father. Let s move him. One two three. One two three. Get that. What happened How could a healthy man fall unconscious overnight What on earth did you do to him I m sorry. He told me he wasn t feeling well last night. But I don t know what happened. He s conscious now. Father. Are you all right Hey. My son. Yes I m all right. He s conscious now. But it s only temporary. Shut it you punk. Father. Don t worry about anything. Okay I Hyunseong. Yes I don t have much time left. Father. Get Han Yihan for me. Okay. I hope she wakes up soon.
